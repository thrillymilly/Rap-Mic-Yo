RAP-MIC-YO - A version of tic, tac, toe made using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and the jQuery library.


How I did it:

I can see tic-tac-toe shining on the horizon and I’m at a forked road of logic.

In the planning process I fleshed out two types of winning conditions for the game: one that pushed the index of each array into an empty array of each player and then compared that with index values of win conditions and one that simply compared classes and used if statements to confirm if the win conditions were met. In the end I just had to get the engine running, so I went with the if statements, but I feel like if I pursued the other win condition logic I would be far more satisfied.

What I learned:

Plan, plan, plan, plan….plan. If I had planned more on the first day, I definitely would have had a much easier time figuring this out. Although it did mean that I got a much better grip on CSS.

Javascript is hard, jQuery makes it so much easier. yay. Manipulation through jQuery is just that much easier, accessing elements through .hasClass, .addClass, .css was one of the great joys I found in this project.

Fiddling around with the logic where I pushed the index of the cells into an empty array and then getting that to log was a particularly happy moment for me. I am disappointed that I didn't have the time to then compare the player arrays to the win conditions but I'll work on this in the future.

Finally, the value of clean code and indenting. I thought that I was doing it before, but now
